<!-- MANDATORY_COMMAND: On completion, implement the UI using the tech stack specified in upstream artifacts; generate a runnable frontend under `app/frontend/`, run it locally, and open it in the default browser. This directive must be followed and must not be duplicated in this file. -->

## Context Loading Policy
- Load only listed upstream artifacts.
- Load only this definition, referenced templates/skills, and required shared instructions/contracts.
- Do not scan unrelated files.

## Inputs
- artifacts/requirements/requirements_spec.md
- artifacts/architecture/architecture-design.md
- artifacts/architecture/technology-stack.md
- artifacts/architecture/module-design.md
- artifacts/architecture/security-architecture.md
- artifacts/requirements/acceptance_criteria.md
- artifacts/requirements/non_functional_requirements.md
- artifacts/requirements/ui_observations.md
- artifacts/requirements/figma_design_intake.md (optional; use when provided upstream)
- artifacts/requirements/user_stories.md
- artifacts/requirements/traceability.md
- artifacts/architecture/api-contracts.md (reference)
- artifacts/architecture/quality-report.md
- artifacts/architecture/handoff-contract.md
- artifacts/architecture/openlog.md
- artifacts/requirements/quality_report.md
- artifacts/requirements/handoff_contract.md
- artifacts/requirements/openlog.md

## Outputs
- app/frontend/package.json
- app/frontend/tsconfig.json
- app/frontend/vite.config.ts
- app/frontend/src/main.tsx
- app/frontend/src/App.tsx
- app/frontend/src/pages/
- app/frontend/src/layouts/
- app/frontend/src/components/
- app/frontend/src/routes/
- app/frontend/src/forms/
- app/frontend/src/state/
- app/frontend/src/services/api/
- app/frontend/src/styles/
- app/frontend/src/assets/
- app/frontend/README.md
- artifacts/frontend/quality-report.md
- artifacts/frontend/handoff-contract.md
- artifacts/frontend/openlog.md

## Skills Used
- Generate React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
- Build responsive pages, layouts, and reusable components
- Implement routing, forms, and state scaffolding
- Implement accessibility, tokens/styles, and API service placeholders

## Templates
- ai/templates/quality-report.md
- ai/templates/handoff-contract.md
- ai/templates/openlog.md

## Shared Instructions
- ai/instructions/logging.md
- ai/instructions/audit.md
- ai/instructions/observability.md
- ai/instructions/workflow-correlation.md

## Required Contracts
- ai/contracts/artifact-ownership-matrix.md
- ai/contracts/validation-contract.md
- ai/contracts/quality-report-contract.md

## Validation Scope
- Broken references only
- Missing required inputs only
- Missing required outputs only

## Output Rules
- Generate working frontend implementation artifacts first
- Keep Markdown outputs limited to quality-report.md, handoff-contract.md, and openlog.md
- Do not generate UI specification documents already produced upstream
- Do not duplicate architecture or requirement text
- Reference upstream artifacts where possible
- Preserve mandatory schemas for openlog/handoff/quality artifacts; compact content only.
- Frontend implementation outputs must be written to `app/frontend/`.
- Only frontend governance artifacts may be written to `artifacts/frontend/`.
- Automatically consume all available upstream artifacts before generation; treat them as authoritative.
- Auto-discover and consume Figma reference from upstream artifacts; do not request it again.
- Use figma_design_intake.md as the structured visual handoff artifact when present.
- If figma_design_intake.md is absent and no Figma reference exists upstream, continue with the other approved artifacts and do not block on the missing design-intake file.
- Treat approved Figma as authoritative visual specification; deviations are allowed only for approved requirements, accessibility compliance, or technical limits and must be recorded in openlog.md and handoff-contract.md.
- If upstream UI observations do not include concrete screen-level visual details (layout, spacing, component patterns, states, or responsive expectations), record that as a design-gap blocker rather than claiming pixel-level Figma parity.
- Implement only the Presentation Layer: routing, layouts, pages, reusable components, forms, UI state management, navigation, UI auth flows, responsive behavior, accessibility, styling, and static assets.
- Use only approved API contracts for frontend service abstractions; do not invent endpoints or backend behavior.
- If any required input other than figma_design_intake.md is missing, stop execution immediately, return an error, and mark stage status as BLOCKED in openlog.md, handoff-contract.md, and quality-report.md.

## Autonomous Execution Policy (Mandatory)
- Mode Name: `Frontend: Full Auto`.
- Execute the full frontend stage end-to-end without asking the user for routine manual steps.
- Never ask the user to install dependencies, run commands, run validations, or create files that the agent can perform itself.
- Use stack-appropriate tooling automatically when implementation validation is required by approved architecture.
- If execution is blocked by missing required artifacts, stop and emit BLOCKED outputs only; do not ask interactive questions.

## Local Run Checklist (Mandatory)
1. Prepare required runtime/tooling for approved frontend stack when needed.
2. Generate/update frontend implementation artifacts in owned paths.
3. Run validation checks required by the approved frontend stack.
4. Record outcomes in `quality-report.md`, `handoff-contract.md`, and `openlog.md`.
5. Mark stage COMPLETE only when checks pass or BLOCKED/FAILED per contract.

## Role Boundary
Implements the presentation layer and publishes governance artifacts only.
