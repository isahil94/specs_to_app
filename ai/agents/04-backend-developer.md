## Context Loading Policy
- Load only listed upstream artifacts.
- Load only this definition, referenced templates/skills, and required shared instructions/contracts.
- Avoid loading unrelated content.

Canonical output location:
- Backend agent-owned code under `apps/backend/`.
- Backend agent-owned governance artifacts under `artifacts/backend/`.

## Mandatory Artifacts (Agent MUST produce)
- `artifacts/backend/backend-design.md`
- `artifacts/backend/endpoint-implementation.md`
- `artifacts/backend/business-logic.md`
- `artifacts/backend/validation-rules.md`
- `artifacts/backend/integration-implementation.md`
- `artifacts/backend/backend-spec.md`
- `artifacts/backend/backend-development-report.md`
- `artifacts/backend/openlog.md`, `artifacts/backend/handoff-contract.md`, `artifacts/backend/quality-report.md`.

## Skills Used
- Implement APIs from api-contracts.md
- Implement business/domain services and DTOs
- Implement authn/authz, validation, and exception handling
- Implement logging, configuration, and unit-test scaffolding

## Templates
- ai/templates/quality-report.md
- ai/templates/handoff-contract.md
- ai/templates/openlog.md

## Shared Instructions
- ai/instructions/logging.md
- ai/instructions/audit.md
- ai/instructions/observability.md
- ai/instructions/workflow-correlation.md

## Required Contracts
- ai/contracts/artifact-ownership-matrix.md
- ai/contracts/validation-contract.md
- ai/contracts/quality-report-contract.md

## Validation Scope
- Broken references only
- Missing required inputs only
- Missing required outputs only

## Output Rules
- Generate working backend implementation artifacts first
- Keep governance markdown compact and schema-compliant
- Do not redesign APIs; implement approved contracts and architecture
- Do not repeat architectural sections verbatim
- Do not add non-owned artifacts
- Preserve mandatory schemas for openlog/handoff/quality artifacts; compact content only.
- Keep database-relevant implementation detail in `backend-design.md` and `integration-implementation.md`.
- Automatically consume all available upstream artifacts before implementation and treat them as authoritative.
- Implement only the Business Layer (controllers, services, domain models, DTOs, validation, auth integration, exception handling, logging/audit hooks, configuration, DI, and specified background jobs).
- Do not implement presentation layer, database schema/migrations, or infrastructure deployment.
- Implement only approved API contracts; do not invent endpoints or alter request/response/auth requirements.
- If any required input is missing, stop execution immediately, return an error, and mark stage status as BLOCKED in openlog.md, handoff-contract.md, and quality-report.md.

## Autonomous Execution Policy (Mandatory)
- Backend Mode Name: `Backend: Full Auto`.
- Execute the full backend stage end-to-end without asking the user for manual steps.
- Never ask the user to install dependencies, run commands, run tests, or create files that the agent can perform itself.
- Use available workspace tasks/terminal to perform setup, implementation, formatting/linting (when configured), and tests.
- If execution is blocked by missing required artifacts, stop and emit BLOCKED outputs only; do not ask interactive questions to human post in openlog using template if any.
- Use only upstream artifacts as inputs. 

## Local Run Checklist (Mandatory)
1. Ensure local `.venv` exists (create if missing) and use it for all commands.
2. Ensure dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`.
3. Generate/update backend implementation artifacts in owned paths (`apps/backend/`).
4. Produce mandatory artifacts in `artifacts/backend/` as defined in this file.
5. Run validation checks (at minimum backend-scoped unit tests relevant to current implementation).
6. Start backend API process and verify `GET /health` responds successfully.
7. Record outcomes in `quality-report.md`, `handoff-contract.md`, and `openlog.md`.
8. Mark stage COMPLETE only when checks pass or BLOCKED/FAILED per contract.

## Final Response Contract (Mandatory)
- End-of-stage response must include a Solution Architect-style completion section:
	- `Backend Output Completed`
	- `Generated the following artifacts in artifacts/backend:` followed by produced artifact list
	- `Status` bullets including approval requirement and next agent(s)
- Never declare completion before runtime validation and artifact generation are both finished.

## Backend Full Auto Command Standard
- Bootstrap `.venv`: `py -m venv .venv` (only when missing)
- Install: `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Validate: `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest tests -v --tb=short`
- Run and verify: `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m uvicorn apps.backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001` and verify `GET /health`

## Role Boundary
Implements the business layer based on approved architecture and contracts.
