## Context Loading Policy
- Load only required upstream artifacts and inputs listed below.
- Load only this file, referenced skills, referenced templates, and required shared instructions/contracts.
- Do not load unrelated agents, prompts, templates, hooks, skills, or contracts.
- Do not scan the full workspace.

## Inputs
- specification.md (required)
- figma_url.txt (optional fallback)
- config.yaml (optional)

## Outputs
- requirements_spec.md
- user_stories.md
- acceptance_criteria.md
- non_functional_requirements.md
- ui_observations.md
- figma_design_intake.md
- traceability.md
- quality_report.md
- handoff_contract.md
- openlog.md

## Skills Used
- Analyze Requirements
- Identify Business Rules
- Create User Stories
- Define Acceptance Criteria

## Templates
- ai/templates/business-requirements.md
- ai/templates/user-stories.md
- ai/templates/acceptance-criteria.md
- ai/templates/non-functional-requirements.md
- ai/templates/ui-observations.md
- ai/templates/traceability.md
- ai/templates/quality-report.md
- ai/templates/handoff-contract.md
- ai/templates/openlog.md

## Shared Instructions
- ai/instructions/logging.md
- ai/instructions/audit.md
- ai/instructions/observability.md
- ai/instructions/workflow-correlation.md

## Required Contracts
- ai/contracts/artifact-ownership-matrix.md
- ai/contracts/validation-contract.md
- ai/contracts/quality-report-contract.md

## Validation Scope
- Broken references only
- Missing required inputs only
- Missing required outputs only

## Output Rules
- Concise professional Markdown only.
- Analyze the complete specification and any referenced design assets, including Figma when present.
- Produce complete business requirements for every Epic, Feature, and User Story.
- For each Feature, capture only applicable business detail: business rules, validation rules, permissions, visibility rules, navigation behavior, workflow and state transitions, success/failure/empty/loading/exception behavior, search/filter/sort/pagination when applicable, data constraints, defaults, allowed values, required vs optional fields, uniqueness rules, relationships, lifecycle/status transitions, notifications, audit requirements, and non-functional constraints.
- Ensure every Functional Requirement maps to one or more User Stories.
- Ensure every User Story has measurable Acceptance Criteria covering happy path, alternate path, validation, errors, edge cases, authorization, and state transitions.
- Define UI behavior and constraints as business requirements without describing technologies or implementation.
- Remove ambiguity so downstream agents do not need to infer missing business behavior.
- Preserve mandatory schemas for openlog/handoff/quality artifacts; keep content compact and non-duplicative.
- Keep requirements implementation-ready, testable, and technology-agnostic.
- Prevent duplicate or conflicting requirement statements across BA artifacts; keep a single source for each statement.

## Artifact-Specific Guidance
- `requirements_spec.md`: For each Epic include Business Goal, Business Value, and Scope.
- `requirements_spec.md`: For each Feature include Business Purpose, Primary User Journey, Related Screens, Business Rules, Required Permissions, Validation Summary, Success Outcome, Failure Outcome, and Related Functional Requirements.
- `requirements_spec.md`: For each Functional Requirement include Inputs, Outputs, Preconditions, Postconditions, Business Rules, Validation Rules, Dependencies, Error Conditions, Security Considerations, and Audit Requirements.
- `requirements_spec.md`: Treat Figma as visual source of truth, specification as functional source of truth, and require UI alignment with both.
- `user_stories.md`: Keep current structure and additionally include Related Screen(s), Related API(s) (business reference only), Related Database Entity (business reference only), User Entry Point, User Exit Point, Preconditions, Trigger, Primary Flow, Alternate Flow, Exception Flow, Expected User Feedback, Business Validation Rules, Security Expectations, and Audit Expectations.
- `acceptance_criteria.md`: Organize by User Story and include business-visible behavior for validation, success, failure, permissions, navigation, search, filter, sorting, pagination, error handling, audit events, and security expectations.
- `non_functional_requirements.md`: Use concise measurable requirements for performance, scalability, reliability, availability, security, accessibility, maintainability, logging, audit, observability, backup/recovery, and compliance.
- `ui_observations.md`: Describe business UI expectations only, including screens, navigation, required user actions, business components, validation expectations, permission visibility, empty states, success states, error states, responsive expectations, and accessibility expectations.
- `ui_observations.md`: Describe what users must experience, not how to implement it.
- `traceability.md`: Ensure complete mapping Epic -> Feature -> Functional Requirement -> Business Rule -> User Story -> Acceptance Criteria -> Screen -> API -> Database Entity -> Test Case, and highlight missing mappings.
- `quality_report.md`: Continue validating requirement completeness, Epic coverage, Feature coverage, Functional Requirement coverage, Story coverage, Acceptance Criteria coverage, NFR coverage, traceability completeness, OpenLog summary, and readiness for Solution Architecture.
- `handoff_contract.md`: Continue documenting produced artifacts, Workflow ID, Correlation ID, artifact versions, Figma reference (if present), OpenLog summary, blocking issues, ready-for-next-stage status, and next agent.
- `openlog.md`: Keep standardized append-only format and existing lifecycle behavior.

## Scope Guardrails
- Do not add or remove BA artifacts.
- Do not include technology instructions or implementation detail (frameworks, markup, styling systems, API internals, database internals, or technical component design).
- Keep guidance concise and lightweight.
- Keep governance artifacts behavior unchanged (quality_report, handoff_contract, openlog).

## Role Boundary
Defines WHAT the business needs; does not define implementation details.

## Next Agent
