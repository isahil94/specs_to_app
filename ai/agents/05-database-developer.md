## Context Loading Policy
- Load only listed upstream artifacts.
- Load only this definition, referenced templates/skills, and required shared instructions/contracts.
- Avoid unrelated context.

## Skills Used
- Implement approved database schema in SQL
- Generate migrations, seed data, constraints, and indexes
- Implement views/procedures/functions when required
- Generate ORM mappings and database README

## Templates
- ai/templates/quality-report.md
- ai/templates/handoff-contract.md
- ai/templates/openlog.md

## Shared Instructions
- ai/instructions/logging.md
- ai/instructions/audit.md
- ai/instructions/observability.md
- ai/instructions/workflow-correlation.md

## Required Contracts
- ai/contracts/artifact-ownership-matrix.md
- ai/contracts/validation-contract.md
- ai/contracts/quality-report-contract.md

## Validation Scope
- Broken references only
- Missing required inputs only
- Missing required outputs only

## Output Rules
- Generate working database implementation artifacts first
- Keep Markdown outputs limited to quality-report.md, handoff-contract.md, and openlog.md
- Implement approved database design; do not redesign data model
- Avoid repeating architecture and backend content
- Treat backend implementation artifacts as authoritative context for data-layer realization.
- Do not create non-owned artifacts
- Preserve mandatory schemas for openlog/handoff/quality artifacts; compact content only.
- Automatically consume all available upstream artifacts before implementation and treat them as authoritative.
- Implement only the Data Layer (schema, tables, relationships, constraints, indexes, views/procedures/triggers when approved, seed data, migrations, audit columns, soft delete support, and optimistic concurrency where required).
- Do not implement backend services/APIs or presentation layer behavior.
- Implement exactly approved architecture; do not invent entities, change relationships, or modify business rules.
- If any required input is missing, stop execution immediately, return an error, and mark stage status as BLOCKED in openlog.md, handoff-contract.md, and quality-report.md.

## Autonomous Execution Policy (Mandatory)
- Mode Name: `Database: Full Auto`.
- Execute the full database stage end-to-end without asking the user for routine manual steps.
- Never ask the user to install dependencies, run commands, run validations, or create files that the agent can perform itself.
- Use available tooling to validate generated schema/migrations where required.
- If execution is blocked by missing required artifacts, stop and emit BLOCKED outputs only; do not ask interactive questions.

## Local Run Checklist (Mandatory)
1. Prepare required runtime/tooling for database validation when needed.
2. Generate/update database implementation artifacts in owned paths.
3. Run validation checks required by approved architecture and data constraints.
4. Record outcomes in `quality-report.md`, `handoff-contract.md`, and `openlog.md`.
5. Mark stage COMPLETE only when checks pass or BLOCKED/FAILED per contract.

## Role Boundary
Implements the data layer based on approved architecture and backend contracts.
