## Context Loading Policy
- Load only listed upstream artifacts.
- Load only this definition, referenced templates/skills, and required shared instructions/contracts.
- Do not scan unrelated files.

## Inputs
- artifacts/requirements/user_stories.md
- artifacts/requirements/acceptance_criteria.md
- artifacts/requirements/non_functional_requirements.md
- artifacts/requirements/traceability.md
- app/frontend/
- app/backend/
- artifacts/database/
- apps/database/

## Outputs
- artifacts/tests/unit/
- artifacts/tests/integration/
- artifacts/tests/api/
- artifacts/tests/ui/
- artifacts/tests/e2e/
- artifacts/tests/fixtures/
- artifacts/tests/data/
- artifacts/tests/config/
- artifacts/tests/run-tests.sh
- artifacts/tests/run-tests.ps1
- artifacts/tests/quality-report.md
- artifacts/tests/handoff-contract.md
- artifacts/tests/openlog.md

## Skills Used
- Generate Unit Tests
- Generate Integration Tests
- Generate API/UI/E2E test suites
- Generate test data, fixtures, config, and execution scripts

## Templates
- ai/templates/quality-report.md
- ai/templates/handoff-contract.md
- ai/templates/openlog.md

## Shared Instructions
- ai/instructions/logging.md
- ai/instructions/audit.md
- ai/instructions/observability.md
- ai/instructions/workflow-correlation.md

## Required Contracts
- ai/contracts/artifact-ownership-matrix.md
- ai/contracts/validation-contract.md
- ai/contracts/quality-report-contract.md

## Validation Scope
- Broken references only
- Missing required inputs only
- Missing required outputs only

## Output Rules
- Generate executable tests and test assets, then execute configured validation/test runs
- Keep Markdown outputs limited to quality-report.md, handoff-contract.md, and openlog.md
- Reference upstream artifacts instead of restating them
- Preserve mandatory schemas for openlog/handoff/quality artifacts; compact content only.

## Autonomous Execution Policy (Mandatory)
- Mode Name: `QA: Full Auto`.
- Execute the full QA stage end-to-end without asking the user for routine manual steps.
- Never ask the user to install dependencies, run commands, execute tests, or create files that the agent can perform itself.
- Use available tooling to run test suites and quality checks automatically.
- If execution is blocked by missing required artifacts, stop and emit BLOCKED outputs only; do not ask interactive questions.

## Local Run Checklist (Mandatory)
1. Prepare required runtime/tooling for test execution when needed.
2. Generate/update test artifacts in owned paths.
3. Execute unit/integration/api/ui/e2e checks applicable to available artifacts.
4. Record outcomes in `quality-report.md`, `handoff-contract.md`, and `openlog.md`.
5. Mark stage COMPLETE only when checks pass or BLOCKED/FAILED per contract.

## Role Boundary
Produces executable test implementation and governance artifacts only.
