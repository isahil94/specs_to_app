# Artifact Ownership Matrix

Contract Version: 1.0.0
Effective Date: 2026-07-01
Status: Approved
Authority: Platform AI Governance Council

---

## 1. Purpose

This document is the single authoritative source of truth for artifact ownership across all SDLC agents.

Every agent **must** consult this matrix before generating any artifact to verify:

1. The artifact is within my ownership scope.
2. I am not regenerating an artifact owned by a downstream or upstream agent.
3. I am consuming upstream artifacts instead of recreating them.
4. I am only extending artifacts explicitly marked as extendable.

Violation of artifact ownership is a **critical guardrail failure**. The offending agent must stop, reference the owning agent, and record the dependency in its Handoff Contract.

---

## 2. Ownership Status Definitions

Every cell in Section 3 uses exactly one of the following statuses.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **OWN** | The agent is the sole creator and owner. Only this agent may create this artifact. No other agent may write to it. |
| **CONSUME** | Read-only input. The agent reads and depends on this artifact but must never modify it. |
| **EXTEND** | The agent may enrich the artifact without changing its original intent. Ownership remains with the originating agent. Only explicitly granted on api-contracts.md for Backend Developer. |
| **REFERENCE** | The artifact is used for context only. No modifications permitted. Lower dependency than CONSUME. |
| **NONE** | The artifact is irrelevant to this stage. The agent must not read or touch it. |

---

## 2.1 Enforcement Rules

These rules apply to every agent, every execution, without exception.

```
BEFORE generating any artifact:
  1. Look up the artifact in Section 3.
  2. Find this agent's column.
  3. Status must be OWN to generate.
  4. If status is CONSUME, EXTEND, REFERENCE, or NONE:
       - Stop. Do not generate this artifact.
       - Identify the OWN agent from Section 3.
       - Record an ownership violation in:
           quality-report.md  (violation log)
           handoff-contract.md (Cross-Agent Dependencies)
           openlog.md          (Open Item with Category: Governance)
       - Reference the owning agent's artifact path instead of generating.
  5. EXTEND is the only exception: Backend Developer may append to
     endpoint-implementation.md as an addendum to api-contracts.md
     without overwriting the original.
```

## 6. Overlap Prevention Rules

The following pairs historically produced overlap. These rules are normative.

### 6.1 Business Analyst ↔ Solution Architect
- Business Analyst must not suggest specific endpoints, HTTP verbs, request/response payloads, or data schemas.
- Solution Architect must not re-analyze or rewrite business requirements; it consumes them.

### 6.2 Solution Architect ↔ Database Developer
- Solution Architect `database-strategy.md` is conceptual only: entity names, relationships, persistence strategy, transaction strategy.
- Database Developer owns all physical schema decisions: table names, columns, data types, indexes, constraints, migrations, seeds.
- If Solution Architect's database-strategy contains DDL, column definitions, or index definitions, those sections must be removed and deferred to Database Developer.

### 6.3 Solution Architect ↔ Backend Developer
- Backend Developer must not alter `api-contracts.md`. Deviations are recorded in `endpoint-implementation-plan.md` with a reference.
- Solution Architect must not produce service implementation details, validation logic, or error handling code.

### 6.4 UI/UX Developer ↔ Backend Developer
- UI/UX Developer produces design specifications; it does not produce code.
- Backend Developer implements services; it does not produce UI specifications.

### 6.5 QA Engineer ↔ All Implementation Agents
- QA Engineer does not modify any implementation artifact. Test code is owned exclusively by QA Engineer.
- QA Engineer's test artifacts are never overwritten by implementation agents.

### 6.6 Reviewer ↔ All Agents

## 7. Conflict Resolution Protocol

When an agent detects it is about to produce an artifact owned by another agent:

```
1. STOP: Do not generate the artifact.
2. IDENTIFY: Locate the owning agent in Section 4 of this document.
3. REFERENCE: Add a reference entry in the current Handoff Contract:
     "Cross-Agent Dependency:
      Artifact: <artifact-name>
      Owner: <owning-agent>
      Action: Deferred. Will be consumed when published by <owning-agent>."
4. CONTINUE: Proceed with artifacts within your ownership scope.
5. DO NOT escalate to Supervisor unless the owning agent's artifact is missing
   and it is a required input — in that case, emit a Blocked event.
```
