# Artifact Contracts

Contract Version: 1.0.0  
Effective Date: 2026-06-30  
Status: Approved

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This document defines the artifact contracts used by the Agentic SDLC platform. It standardizes ownership, structure, validation, versioning, and lifecycle for all workflow artifacts.

This contract is implementation-independent and applies to all agents, the Supervisor, and orchestration services.

Related contracts:
- artifact-ownership-matrix.md (authoritative per-agent ownership table — consult before generating any artifact)
- event-contracts.md
- workflow-state.md
- memory-contract.md
- validation-contract.md
- quality-report-contract.md

## 2. Normative Terms
- Artifact: A persisted, versioned deliverable produced by exactly one owner agent.
- Owner Agent: The single agent responsible for authoring and publishing an artifact.
- Consumer Agent: Any agent that reads an artifact.
- Artifact Reference: A pointer to an artifact location and version; never artifact content.
- Workflow: End-to-end execution from specification input to documentation output.

## 3. Global Artifact Rules
1. Each artifact has exactly one owner.
2. Agents may read any artifact but must never overwrite artifacts owned by another agent.
3. Any update to an artifact creates a new semantic version.
4. Artifact metadata is mandatory and immutable after publication except status fields managed by Supervisor.
5. Artifacts are immutable after status Published; corrections require a new version.
6. Artifact content must pass validation-contract.md before publication.

## 4. Common Artifact Envelope (Required for Every Artifact)
All artifacts include the following metadata block.

Required fields:
- artifactId: Globally unique artifact identifier.
- artifactType: Contracted artifact name (for example, requirements.md).
- workflowId: Workflow identifier.
- executionId: Execution identifier.
- ownerAgentId: Owning agent identifier.
- version: Semantic version in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
- status: Draft | Validated | Published | Deprecated | Archived.
- createdAt: ISO-8601 timestamp.
- updatedAt: ISO-8601 timestamp.
- inputReferences: List of artifact references used to produce this artifact.
- checksum: Content integrity hash.

Optional fields:
- tags: Classification tags.
- supersedes: Prior artifact version reference.
- qualityReportRef: Reference to quality report artifact.
- approvalRef: Reference to approval request/response.

Example structure:
```yaml
metadata:
  artifactId: art-architecture-0007
  artifactType: architecture.md
  workflowId: wf-2026-06-30-001
  executionId: exec-0142
  ownerAgentId: solution-architect
  version: 1.2.0
  status: Published
  createdAt: 2026-06-30T09:12:11Z
  updatedAt: 2026-06-30T09:38:44Z
  inputReferences:
    - artifactId: art-requirements-0003
      version: 1.0.0
  checksum: sha256:9f2d...
  tags: [architecture, baseline]
  qualityReportRef: qr-solution-architect-0142
content:
  ...
```

## 5. Standard Versioning and Lifecycle
Versioning (applies to all artifacts):
- MAJOR: Breaking structural or semantic contract changes.
- MINOR: Backward-compatible content expansion.
- PATCH: Corrections with no contract break.

Lifecycle (applies to all artifacts):
1. Draft
2. Validated
3. Published
4. Deprecated (optional)
5. Archived

## 7. Artifact-Specific Contracts

Business Analyst consolidation policy:
- BA artifact contracts are limited to `requirements_spec.md`, `user_stories.md`, `acceptance_criteria.md`, `non_functional_requirements.md`, `ui_observations.md`, `traceability.md`, `quality_report.md`, `handoff_contract.md`, and `openlog.md`.
- Figma URL, when present, is consumed from `specification.md` and propagated unchanged in BA handoff.
- Acceptance criteria remain centralized in `acceptance_criteria.md`; user stories must reference but not duplicate.

## 8. Ownership Enforcement
1. Owner-only write: Only owner agent can create or publish new versions for its artifact type.
2. Consumer read-only: Consumer agents can reference but cannot mutate owner artifacts.
3. Supervisor exception: Supervisor may change artifact status only for governance transitions (for example, Deprecated, Archived) with audit trail.

## 9. Traceability Requirements
Every artifact must include:
- Input artifact references with versions.
- Requirement and story links where applicable.
- Quality report reference.
- Approval reference when generated under blocked or exception conditions.

## 10. Compatibility and Change Control
- Contract-breaking changes require MAJOR version increments and Supervisor approval.
- Non-breaking field additions require MINOR version increments.
- Editorial fixes require PATCH increments.
- Consumers must declare supported major versions for each artifact type.
