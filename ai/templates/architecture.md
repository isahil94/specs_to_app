# Architecture Template

## Purpose
Describe system structure, component boundaries, interfaces, and architectural decisions.

## Downstream Readiness Expectations
- Produce architecture artifacts that are detailed enough for frontend, backend, and database implementation without follow-up clarification.
- Define component boundaries, interfaces, contracts, state transitions, error handling, security controls, and deployment concerns explicitly.
- Include Mermaid sequence diagrams in architecture-design.md for authentication, workflow, and cross-service interactions.
- Include interaction or deployment diagrams where cross-service or cross-layer behavior is important.
- Ensure the generated artifacts are directly consumable by downstream implementation stages.
