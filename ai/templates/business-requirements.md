# Business Requirements Template

## Purpose
Define the master business specification in a traceable, implementation-ready format.

## Downstream Readiness Expectations
- Produce business artifacts that are detailed enough for UI/UX, Backend, and Database agents to implement without inferencing missing behavior.
- Capture user journeys, validation rules, state transitions, permissions, notifications, audit expectations, and data constraints explicitly.
- Include Mermaid flow diagrams in business_process_flows.md for non-trivial workflows and lifecycle paths.
- Include concise supporting diagrams or visual structure in requirements_spec.md or ui_observations.md where they improve downstream clarity.
- Ensure the generated artifacts are directly consumable by downstream stages without needing extra interpretation.
