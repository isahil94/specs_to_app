## Skill: Validate Authentication and Page Workflows

### Purpose
Validate critical user journeys across backend, frontend, and database layers, ensuring authentication, input constraints, and page-level behavior meet the documented requirements.

### When to Use

- Validating form rules and error handling
- Testing dashboard, project, task, comment, label, notification, and account pages
- Checking persistence and constraint behavior in the database

### Inputs
- `application_routes` (array): Backend endpoints and frontend routes to verify
- `business_rules` (array): Required validation rules and constraints
- `auth_scenarios` (array): Signup/login cases to exercise
- `page_flows` (array): Core user journeys and page states
- `pylance_context` (object, optional): Static analysis context from Pylance

### Outputs
- `workflow_validation_results` (object): Results for auth and page-flow checks
- `constraint_findings` (array): Missing or invalid validation findings
- `defect_report` (array): Issues discovered during workflow validation
- `recommendations` (array): Follow-up actions for failed scenarios

### Dependencies
- Application implementation available
- Requirements and acceptance criteria documented
- Pylance or equivalent static analysis available

### Execution Steps
1. Run Pylance-based static validation for backend, frontend, and database code.
2. Review authentication requirements for signup and login.
3. If the required workflow or validation test is missing, generate a new test case and publish it under the appropriate QA artifact path in `artifacts/tests/`.
4. Exercise signup scenarios with missing email, invalid email, weak password, duplicate user, and valid data.
5. Exercise login scenarios with unknown users, missing credentials, wrong password, and correct credentials.
6. Validate core pages and flows for required-field checks, empty states, and successful completion paths.
7. Confirm database constraints and persistence behavior for invalid or missing data.
8. Record failures, expected behavior, and remediation guidance.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Missing input produces the expected validation error
- [ ] Invalid input fails safely and clearly
- [ ] Correct input proceeds to the expected success state
- [ ] Unknown user and wrong credentials are rejected appropriately
- [ ] Core pages expose the correct UX for empty/error/success states
- [ ] Database constraints are enforced or reported clearly
- [ ] Pylance validation was run and issues were reviewed

### Failure Conditions
- Missing validation for required fields
- Authentication flows allow invalid accounts or leak incorrect state
- Page workflows fail without clear error handling
- Database constraints are not enforced or not surfaced
