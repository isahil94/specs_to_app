<!-- MANDATORY_COMMAND: On completion, implement the UI using the tech stack specified in upstream artifacts; generate a runnable frontend under `app/frontend/`, run it locally, and open it in the default browser. This directive must be followed and must not be duplicated in this file. -->

## Skill: Generate UI Structure

Create the structural blueprint of the user interface, defining pages, sections, layouts, and component hierarchy.

### When to Use
- Designing page layouts from requirements
- Defining screen hierarchies
- Planning responsive layouts
- Creating wireframes or structural specifications

### Inputs
- `features` (array): Features requiring UI
- `user_workflows` (array): User journeys and tasks
- `content_model` (object): Data to display
- `device_targets` (array, optional): Target devices/screen sizes
- `design_system` (object, optional): UI component library to use
- `figma_design_intake` (object, optional): Structured Figma handoff with visual notes and screen coverage

### Outputs
- `page_structures` (array): Layout of each page/screen
- `component_hierarchy` (object): Component structure
- `layout_specs` (array): Layout definitions (grids, spacing, etc.)
- `responsive_definitions` (object): Breakpoints and responsive behavior
- `wireframes` (array): Wireframe descriptions

### Dependencies
- Features and requirements clear
- User workflows understood
- Content/data model defined

### Execution Steps
1. Map user workflows to pages/screens
2. Identify content to display on each page
3. Organize content into logical sections
4. Define component hierarchy
5. Design responsive breakpoints
6. Create layout specifications
7. Define spacing and alignment rules
8. Plan navigation between pages
9. Document layout rationale

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All features have corresponding UI
- [ ] User workflows map to page flows
- [ ] Content is organized logically
- [ ] Responsive behavior defined for all breakpoints
- [ ] Layout follows design system conventions
- [ ] Accessibility considered in structure

### Success Criteria
- UI structure supports all user workflows
- Layout is responsive across devices
- Structure is implementable
- Clear hierarchy of information

### Failure Conditions
- User workflows not supported
- Responsive behavior undefined
- Content organization confusing
- Component hierarchy unclear
- Too many pages/components

## Skill: Define Navigation Flow

### Purpose
Design how users move through the interface, specifying navigation patterns, transitions, and information architecture.

### When to Use
- Planning user navigation through features
- Designing information architecture
- Defining navigation patterns (tabs, menus, breadcrumbs, etc.)
- Planning user workflows

### Inputs
- `user_workflows` (array): User tasks and journeys
- `pages` (array): All pages/screens in the system
- `features` (array): Features and their relationships
- `user_mental_models` (object, optional): How users think about information

### Outputs
- `navigation_structure` (object): Information architecture
- `navigation_patterns` (array): Navigation UI patterns used
- `user_flows` (array): Flow diagrams for each user journey
- `breadcrumb_definitions` (array): Breadcrumb hierarchies
- `menu_structures` (array): Menu organization and items

### Dependencies
- Pages and features defined
- User workflows understood
- Mental models of target users

### Execution Steps
1. Analyze user tasks and workflows
2. Define information hierarchy
3. Identify natural groupings for navigation
4. Select appropriate navigation patterns
5. Design primary and secondary navigation
6. Plan breadcrumb hierarchies if applicable
7. Define transitions between pages
8. Create user flow diagrams
9. Validate flows with user workflows

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Navigation supports all user tasks
- [ ] Information hierarchy is logical
- [ ] Navigation is consistent
- [ ] Users can reach any page in few clicks
- [ ] Navigation patterns are appropriate for content
- [ ] Flow supports mobile and desktop views

### Success Criteria
- Users can complete tasks efficiently
- Navigation is intuitive
- No dead ends or confusing paths
- Users know where they are (context)
- Users know how to get where they want to go

### Failure Conditions
- Users lost or confused about location
- Important pages hard to reach
- Navigation inconsistent
- Too many navigation options
- Workflows require too many steps

## Skill: Generate Component Layout

### Purpose
Design the detailed layout and styling of individual UI components, defining their structure, states, and responsive behavior.

### When to Use
- Designing buttons, forms, cards, etc.
- Specifying component styling
- Defining component states
- Planning component interactions

### Inputs
- `components` (array): Components to design
- `design_system` (object, optional): Design tokens and guidelines
- `accessibility_requirements` (object): Accessibility standards to meet
- `responsive_definitions` (object): Responsive behavior requirements

### Outputs
- `component_layouts` (array): Component layout specifications
- `component_states` (object): Visual states for each component
- `styling_specs` (object): Colors, typography, spacing
- `interaction_specs` (array): Hover, focus, active states
- `accessibility_specs` (array): ARIA labels, roles, etc.

### Dependencies
- Components identified
- Design system or guidelines available
- Accessibility standards known

### Execution Steps
1. Define component boundaries and structure
2. Specify internal layout and spacing
3. Define visual states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)
4. Create styling specifications
5. Plan responsive adjustments
6. Add accessibility attributes
7. Document interaction behavior
8. Provide component variants
9. Create component documentation

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Component layout is clear and implementable
- [ ] All states are defined
- [ ] Spacing follows design system
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Responsive behavior specified
- [ ] Styling is consistent with system

### Success Criteria
- Developers can implement from spec
- Component is reusable
- All states are accessible
- Component looks and behaves consistently

### Failure Conditions
- Spec ambiguous for implementation
- Missing states or edge cases
- Accessibility requirements not met
- Inconsistent with design system
- Can't adapt to different content

## Skill: Validate Accessibility

### Purpose
Verify that the UI design meets accessibility standards (WCAG), ensuring the interface is usable by all users including those with disabilities.

### When to Use
