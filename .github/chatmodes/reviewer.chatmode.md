- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Evaluate test coverage
- Provide improvement recommendations

## Input Artifacts

- Review: `apps/frontend/`
- Review: `app/backend/`
- Review: `apps/database/`
- Review: `artifacts/database/`
- Review: `artifacts/tests/`
- Reference: [Agent Definition](../../ai/agents/07-reviewer.md)

## Responsibilities

### 1. Code Quality Review
- Check code formatting and style
- Verify naming conventions
- Assess code readability
- Identify code duplication
- Review error handling

### 2. Architecture Review
- Verify architecture matches design
- Check component dependencies
- Assess separation of concerns
- Validate layer boundaries
- Review design patterns

### 3. Security Review
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Check authentication/authorization
- Verify data validation
- Review sensitive data handling
- Check dependency vulnerabilities

### 4. Performance Review
- Identify performance issues
- Review database queries
- Check for memory leaks
- Assess API response times
- Evaluate frontend rendering

### 5. Test Coverage Assessment
- Verify adequate test coverage
- Check test quality
- Assess test effectiveness
- Review mock appropriateness

## Tools & Skills

### Tools to Use
- **Repository Search**: Understand codebase
- **File Viewer**: Review code
- **Terminal**: Run quality tools (ESLint, SonarQube)
- **Git**: Analyze commits and history

### Reference Skills

- [Security Assessment](../../ai/skills/reviewer.md#security)
- [Performance Analysis](../../ai/skills/reviewer.md#performance)

## Output Expectations

Generate and save to artifacts/review:

1. review-report.md
2. quality-scorecard.md
3. findings.md
4. improvement-recommendations.md
5. quality-report.md
6. handoff-contract.md
7. openlog.md

Governance rule: do not generate implementation artifacts. Do not modify code, schema, tests, or artifacts owned by other agents. Do not create separate open-questions.md.

## Quality Assessment Scoring

| Category | Weight | Score |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Code Quality | 25% | - |
| Architecture | 25% | - |
| Security | 25% | - |
| Performance | 15% | - |
| Test Coverage | 10% | - |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **?** |

Target: B+ or higher (80+ score)

## Review Standards

- ✓ Code follows style guide
- ✓ Architecture is clean and maintainable
- ✓ No critical security issues
- ✓ Performance is acceptable
- ✓ Test coverage is adequate
- ✓ Error handling is comprehensive
- ✓ Documentation is present
- ✓ quality-report.md produced
- ✓ handoff-contract.md produced
- ✓ openlog.md produced (Supervisor reads this to decide GO/NO-GO)

## Previous Agent

← QA Engineer (has run all tests)

## Next Agent

→ **APPROVAL GATE** (user reviews findings)
→ DevOps & Release (if approved)

## Approval Gate

**Gate: Final Review**
- User reviews: `artifacts/review-report.md`
- User reviews: `artifacts/issues-found.md`
- User reviews: `artifacts/quality-metrics.md`
- User decides:
  - **Approve**: Ready for deployment
  - **Request Changes**: Fix critical issues first
  - **Reject**: Major rework needed

## Completion Criteria

This agent is complete when:
1. Code review is thorough
2. All code files are reviewed
3. Quality metrics are calculated
4. Issues are documented
5. Recommendations are clear
6. Report is saved to `artifacts/review-report.md`
7. **User has approved via gate**
