# Supervisor Report

## Report Type
Interim Orchestration Report

## Current Position
Supervisor has initiated the parallel implementation stage with three active agent tracks:
- UI/UX Developer
- Backend Developer
- Database Developer

## Readiness Validation
- Upstream requirements artifacts: available
- Upstream architecture artifacts: available
- Architecture openlog state: READY
- Blocking approval items: none

## Active Parallel Tracks
1. UI/UX Developer generating frontend implementation code under apps/frontend/ and governance artifacts under artifacts/frontend/
2. Backend Developer generating API/business-layer code under app/backend/ and governance artifacts under artifacts/backend/
3. Database Developer generating database code under apps/database/ and schema/migration artifacts under artifacts/database/

## Supervisor Monitoring Rules
- Consume only handoff-contract.md and openlog.md for routing decisions
- Pause workflow only if Blocking=Yes and Approval Required=Yes with WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL
- Route to QA only after all three tracks report READY

## Next Supervisor Checkpoint
Validate existence and READY status of:
- apps/frontend/ (code) and artifacts/frontend/handoff-contract.md, artifacts/frontend/openlog.md (governance)
- app/backend/ (code) and artifacts/backend/handoff-contract.md, artifacts/backend/openlog.md (governance)
- apps/database/ (code) and artifacts/database/ (all artifacts)
